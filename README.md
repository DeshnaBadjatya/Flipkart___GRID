EXPIRY DATE DETECTION 

Introduction : Expiry date detection can be very helpful in many real-world scenarios. Either to aid the visually impaired or to just make it easier to read expiry dates which could be printed in various formats and fonts, implementing an automated date detector could be beneficial. This work utilized concepts of opencv and tesseract in order to detect the expiry date printed on it and find the days remaining.
This study proposes a generalized framework for detecting and understanding product expiration dates. The proposed framework consists of three networks: Object Detection Network, which detects labels from a live webcam feed; (Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Network, which extracts the text corresponding to the expiry date from the detected labels; and Date Processing Network, which computes the remaining days until the expiry date and displays the results in real-time.

Fig The overall architecture of the proposed framework for expiration date detection and understanding.

The proposed framework can handle challenging expiration date cases and distinguish 13 different date formats. It can detect and understand the expiration dates even when the input image contains multiple dates.Moreover, the proposed framework can detect date, days remaining from the current date.
